                        Virat Kohli was in a high profile relationship with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma.
                        The pair reportedly broke up in early 2016, but they later patched up and got back together.

                    <li>
                        Virat and Anushka Sharma got married on December 11, 2017. The two tied the knot at Borgo

                        The Virat and Anushka (Virushka) marriage was a very private affair and no one knew of the

                        Virat Kohli is known his tremendous mental strength and one incident amply testifies it.
                        When Virat Kohli lost his father he was in the midst of a Ranji Trophy match, playing for Delhi.
                        He got a call at 3 am and came to know that his father has died. He was the overnight batsman
                        for Delhi and his team was in a difficult situation.
                        He scored a match saving 90 runs for his team the next day and went to his dad's funeral after
                        that innings.
